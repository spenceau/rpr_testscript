# rpr_testscript
temporary repo; cannot seem to clone fork of the official RPR Blender Plug-in and contribute to cmd-line tools subdir

## To Run
python cmd_script.py --blender-path BLENDER_EXE --scene-path BLEND_FILES_SUBDIR --scene-name SCENE

## TODO
need to fix screenshotting as it does render viewport in interactive/fast as well as saves the final rendered image
