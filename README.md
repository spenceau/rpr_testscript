# rpr_testscript
temporary repo; cannot seem to clone fork of the official RPR Blender Plug-in and contribute to cmd-line tools subdir

## To Run
python test_blender.py --blender-path BLENDER_PATH --scene-path SCENE_PATH --scene-name SCENE

## TODO
need to fix screenshotting as it does render viewport in interactive/fast as well as saves the final rendered image
